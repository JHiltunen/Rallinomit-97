Joonas tuned his Fiesta field car everyday after school, and during weekends he and his friends would always have a fiesta in his Fiesta, and that meant pushing the car to its absolute limits by driving it around on the fields. Joonas enslaved himself by following the sheepish career path of coding, which he knew would lead him to a dead-end job. He quit school after the second term and began to follow his dreams to become a racecar driver. Joonas is now racing against two other good-for-nothing hicks in a race of his lifetime. It's now or never!"),
